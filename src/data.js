We will write user stories that help you understand their problems. We will use story mapping to create meaningful and insightful choices for your clients. Finally, we'll use release planning to predict and plan, together, where the project will end up. Join us the 26th edition of Tinel Meetup and find out how you can turn the conversation into software.",
